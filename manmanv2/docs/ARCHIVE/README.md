# ManManV2 Implementation Documents Archive

This directory contains historical design documents and implementation reports that describe how various features were implemented in ManManV2.

## Contents

- **self-registration.md** - Self-registration implementation design
- **SUMMARY-self-registration.md** - Self-registration completion summary
- **server-identification.md** - Server identification mechanism design
- **CHANGELOG-self-registration.md** - Changelog for self-registration
- **testing-self-registration.md** - Testing approach for self-registration
- **containerized-deployment.md** - Containerized deployment design

## Why Archive These?

These documents describe implementation details and design decisions that are now:
- Reflected in the actual source code (//manmanv2/host, //manmanv2/api)
- Covered in current documentation (../ARCHITECTURE.md, ../README.md, ../DEPLOYMENT.md)
- Part of completed features

## Using These Documents

For current documentation, see:
- [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) - System design and component overview
- [../README.md](../README.md) - Local development setup
- [../host/DEPLOYMENT.md](../host/DEPLOYMENT.md) - Host manager deployment
- [../../manman/docs/](../../manman/docs/) - Feature-specific documentation

These archive documents are useful for understanding the historical context of how decisions were made, but the source code and current documentation are the source of truth.
