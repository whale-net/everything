# Before and After Comparison

## Before This Feature

### GitHub Actions Workflow
When you selected `all` for apps or charts:
```
Apps: all
Charts: all
```
**Result**: Released ALL apps and charts including demo domain

### Problem
- Easy to accidentally include demo/example apps in production releases
- No way to exclude demo without listing all apps individually
- Risk of publishing non-production-ready demo code

## After This Feature

### GitHub Actions Workflow
When you select `all` for apps or charts:

#### Option 1: Production Release (Default)
```
Apps: all
Charts: all
Include demo domain: ❌ (unchecked)
```
**Result**: Released ALL apps and charts **EXCEPT** demo domain
- Safer for production
- Demo excluded by default

#### Option 2: Full Release (Explicit)
```
Apps: all
Charts: all
Include demo domain: ✅ (checked)
```
**Result**: Released ALL apps and charts **INCLUDING** demo domain
- Must explicitly check box
- Clear intent to include demo

## CLI Comparison

### Before
```bash
# No way to exclude demo with 'all'
bazel run //tools:release -- plan --apps all --version v1.0.0
# ↓ Includes demo domain (risky)
```

### After
```bash
# Default excludes demo (safe)
bazel run //tools:release -- plan --apps all --version v1.0.0
# ↓ Excludes demo domain (safe by default)

# Explicit include when needed
bazel run //tools:release -- plan --apps all --version v1.0.0 --include-demo
# ↓ Includes demo domain (explicit intent)
```

## Impact

### What Changed
1. ✅ `all` now excludes demo domain by default for apps
2. ✅ `all` now excludes demo domain by default for charts
3. ✅ New `--include-demo` flag to include demo when needed
4. ✅ New checkbox in GitHub Actions UI

### What Didn't Change
1. ✅ Specific app names (e.g., `hello_python`) work the same
2. ✅ Domain names (e.g., `demo`, `manman`) work the same
3. ✅ Comma-separated lists work the same
4. ✅ All existing workflows continue to work

## Migration Guide

### If You Were Using `all` for Production
**Before**: 
- Used `all` and hoped demo wasn't included
- Or manually listed all non-demo apps

**After**:
- Just use `all` - demo is automatically excluded! ✅
- No changes needed to your workflow

### If You Were Using `all` for Testing/Demo
**Before**:
- Used `all` and it included demo

**After**:
- Use `all` with `--include-demo` flag or check the box
- Small change: one extra checkbox or flag

### If You Were Using Specific Names
**Before**:
- Listed specific apps: `hello_python,hello_go`
- Listed specific charts: `helm-demo-hello-fastapi`
- Used domain names: `demo`, `manman`

**After**:
- Everything works exactly the same ✅
- No changes needed

## Summary

This feature makes production releases **safer by default** by excluding demo domain when using `all`. You must now **explicitly opt-in** to include demo domain, reducing the risk of accidentally publishing demo/example code to production.

The change is **backward compatible** for all use cases except the rare case where you specifically wanted demo included with `all` - and even then, it's just one checkbox or flag to add.
