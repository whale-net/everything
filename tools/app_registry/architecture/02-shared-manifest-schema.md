# Shared manifest schema

The registry does **not** define its own app-manifest shape. `AppManifest`,
`ChartManifest`, `AppManifestSet` and `DeployUnit` live in
[`//tools/appmeta/proto`](../appmeta/README.md), the schema of record for the
JSON that `app_metadata` and `helm_chart_metadata` emit.

This matters because two Go structs already decode that JSON — one in
`release_helper_go`, one in `tools/helm/composer.go` — and they had drifted from
each other and from the Starlark rule. The registry would have been a third.
Instead it consumes the shared contract, so `ReconcileApps` takes an
`AppManifestSet` verbatim and adding a field to `release_app` propagates
everywhere with no per-consumer edit.

Dependency direction is load-bearing: `appmeta` depends on nothing, and the
schema must not live under `app_registry`, or `tools/helm` would depend on the
registry in order to build a chart.

Drift is prevented by the contract test described in the appmeta README, not by
the shared type alone — `protojson` decoding with `DiscardUnknown: false` turns
any unmodelled Starlark output key into a test failure.
