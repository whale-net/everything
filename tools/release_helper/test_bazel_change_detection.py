Unit tests for the Bazel-based change detection approach.

Tests the improved change detection that relies on Bazel's dependency 
analysis rather than making assumptions about "infrastructure" changes.

The optimized implementation uses rdeps() for efficient reverse dependency
queries instead of computing deps() for each app individually.

        This is a documentation test that explains the performance improvements
        made to address slow change detection even when tests are cached.
        
        PROBLEM:
        The original implementation was slow because it:
        1. Called list_all_apps() which builds metadata for ALL apps in the repo
        2. For EACH app, ran get_app_metadata() (redundant metadata builds)
        3. For EACH app, ran deps(app_target) which computes full dependency trees
        
        With N apps, this meant:
        - N metadata builds (already built in step 1)
        - N expensive deps() queries computing full dependency trees
        - Time complexity: O(N * D) where D is avg dependency tree depth
        
        SOLUTION:
        The optimized implementation:
        1. Finds affected targets from changed files (same as before)
        2. Runs ONE rdeps() query to find all app_metadata targets that depend
           on any affected target: kind(app_metadata, rdeps(//..., set(targets)))
        3. Only builds metadata for the affected apps found in step 2
        
        Performance improvements:
        - 1 query instead of N queries (where N = number of apps)
        - No redundant metadata builds
        - rdeps() is optimized for reverse lookups
        - Time complexity: O(A + M) where A is affected apps, M is affected targets
        
        Real-world impact:
        - For repos with many apps but few affected: ~10-100x faster
        - Cached test runs no longer slowed down by change detection
        - Scales better as repository grows
