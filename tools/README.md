## Release Helper

The release helper (`release_helper.py`) is a comprehensive tool for managing app releases and container images.

### Key Commands
```bash
# List all apps with release metadata
bazel run //tools:release -- list

# Detect apps that have changed since last tag
bazel run //tools:release -- changes

# Build and load a container image for an app
bazel run //tools:release -- build <app_name>

# Release an app with version and optional commit tag
bazel run //tools:release -- release <app_name> --version <version> --commit <sha>

# Plan a release (used by CI)
bazel run //tools:release -- plan --event-type tag_push --version <version>
```

The release helper ensures consistent handling of container images, version validation, and integration with CI/CD workflows.
