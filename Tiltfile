# Everything Monorepo - Root Tiltfile
# 
# This is a minimal root Tiltfile that provides shared utilities.
# Individual domains should have their own Tiltfile that can be run standalone.
#
# Usage:
#   - For ManMan development: cd manman && tilt up
#   - For other domains: cd <domain> && tilt up
#
# This root Tiltfile is intentionally minimal - domains are self-contained.
