# The `scope` table (LB1)

Every entity table this milestone (and every later one) adds carries a
non-null `scope_id` foreign key — including this task, which seeds
`scope` before any entity table exists. `scope`, not any entity row, owns
this repo's forge coordinates:

- `repo_full_name` (e.g. `whale-net/everything`)
- `default_branch` (e.g. `main`)
- `pointer_issue_number` (nullable — unset until a later task's FR20
  pointer-artifact issue exists)

**Why the indirection, not a bare `repo_full_name` column on every
table:** with a natural key, a repo rename is a rewrite of every row that
carries it; with a surrogate `scope_id`, it is a single-row edit on
`scope`. It also gives a later cross-product decision (a `Later` capability
in `PRODUCT.md`) somewhere to live without a migration. M1 seeds exactly
one `scope` row (`krill/migrate/seed`) and exposes no CRUD over it — the
scope selector, per-scope authorization, and whether a scope is a repo or
an org are all deferred to whenever those capabilities are actually
scoped.

**Mutation-shape boundary call (LB3):** `scope` is a plain mutable config
row — not SCD2 (`AGENTS.md` "SCD2" — no `valid_from`/`valid_to`) and not
the work axis's append-only + claimed shape. See the schema comment in
`migrate/schema/migrations/001_scope.up.sql` for the same reasoning
in-line with the DDL it applies to.
