## Issue Title: Release workflow fails: Docker push to GHCR is unauthorized

### Description:
The Release workflow fails at the Docker push step with the error: 'unauthenticated: User cannot be authenticated with the token provided.' The workflow currently uses `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` for Docker login to ghcr.io, but this token does not have sufficient permissions to push images to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

### Steps to reproduce:
- Run the Release workflow on main or via tag.
- Observe failure at the Docker push step.

### Error Log:
```
authorized: unauthenticated: User cannot be authenticated with the token provided.
Error: Command '['docker', 'push', 'ghcr.io/whale-net/hello_go:latest']' returned non-zero exit status 1.
```

### Proposed Solution:
- Create a new GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with write:packages and read:packages scopes.
- Add the PAT as a secret in the repository (e.g., GHCR_PAT).
- Update the Docker login step in .github/workflows/release.yml to use the PAT secret for authentication.
