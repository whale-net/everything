# Design Documents Archive

This directory contains historical design documents and implementation notes that document how various features were implemented. These are **for reference only** and should not be used as current documentation.

## Contents

- **initial-plan.md** - Early project planning notes
- **status-service-split.md** - Design for splitting status services
- **status-service-implementation.md** - Implementation notes for status service
- **CONFIGURATION_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Configuration system design and implementation
- **PARAMETER_NORMALIZATION.md** - Parameter normalization design
- **GAME_ACTIONS.md** - Game action system design
- **CONFIGURATION_STRATEGIES.md** - Configuration strategy pattern design

## Why Archive These?

These documents describe how decisions were made during implementation, but:
- The actual code is the source of truth
- Current documentation is in [../](../)
- These reflect past development iterations

## Using These Documents

If you need to understand:
- **Architecture**: See [../../ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) (V2) or [../../README.md](../../README.md) (V1)
- **Current features**: See [../../docs/](../../docs/)
- **How something works**: Check the actual source code in [../../src/](../../src/) or [../../../../../../manmanv2/](../../../../../../manmanv2/)
