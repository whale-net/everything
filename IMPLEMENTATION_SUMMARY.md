## Key Features

### ‚úÖ Bazel Integration
- Native Bazel coverage using `bazel coverage //...`
- LCOV format reports (industry standard)
- Instrumentation filter to focus on workspace code
- Works with Python tests (Go may need additional config)

### ‚úÖ Codecov Integration
- Automatic upload on every CI run
- PR comments with coverage diff
- Coverage dashboard and trends
- Configurable thresholds and ignore patterns

### ‚úÖ Developer Experience
- Simple commands: `bazel coverage //...`
- Local HTML reports: `./tools/collect_coverage.sh`
- Quick reference documentation
- Automated workflows

### ‚úÖ CI/CD Automation
- Coverage collected automatically
- Uploads to Codecov with token
- Continues even if some tests fail
- No manual intervention needed (after setup)

## What Developers Get

### Local Development
```bash
# During development - fast feedback
bazel test //...

# Before committing - comprehensive check
bazel coverage //...

# Optional HTML report
./tools/collect_coverage.sh
open coverage_output/html/index.html
```

### Pull Requests
- ‚úÖ Codecov bot comments on every PR
- ‚úÖ Coverage diff (what changed)
- ‚úÖ Coverage trends over time
- ‚úÖ Dashboard: https://codecov.io/gh/whale-net/everything

### CI Pipeline
- ‚úÖ Automatic coverage collection
- ‚úÖ No extra CI configuration needed
- ‚úÖ Works on all branches
- ‚úÖ Fails gracefully if Codecov is down

## Post-Merge Requirements

### 1. Update uv.lock (Required)
New dependencies were added to `pyproject.toml` but the lock file needs updating:

```bash
# Option A: GitHub Actions
Actions ‚Üí "Update uv.lock" ‚Üí Run workflow ‚Üí Merge PR

# Option B: Local
./tools/update_lock.sh
git commit uv.lock -m "Update uv.lock with coverage dependencies"
git push
```

### 2. Configure Codecov (Required)
Coverage uploads need the Codecov token:

1. Link repository: https://codecov.io ‚Üí Add repository
2. Get token: Codecov Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Copy token
3. Add secret: GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Add `CODECOV_TOKEN`

See [docs/POST_MERGE_SETUP.md](POST_MERGE_SETUP.md) for detailed steps.

## Testing the Implementation

### After Lock File Update

```bash
# Test single target
bazel coverage //demo/hello_python:test_main

# Test all targets
bazel coverage //...

# Verify coverage file exists
ls $(bazel info output_path)/_coverage/_coverage_report.dat

# Generate HTML report
./tools/collect_coverage.sh
```

### After Codecov Setup

1. Create a test PR
2. Wait for CI to complete
3. Check for Codecov bot comment
4. Verify coverage at https://codecov.io/gh/whale-net/everything

## Coverage Scope

### Included in Coverage
- ‚úÖ All workspace code (`//`)
- ‚úÖ Application code (`//manman/...`)
- ‚úÖ Shared libraries (`//libs/...`)
- ‚úÖ Demo applications (`//demo/...`)
- ‚úÖ Test code (via `--instrument_test_targets`)

### Excluded from Coverage
- ‚ùå External dependencies (`@external//...`)
- ‚ùå Bazel build outputs (`bazel-out/`)
- ‚ùå Bazel symlinks (`bazel-*`)
- ‚ùå Test files in reports (for cleaner metrics)

## Maintenance

### Adding Dependencies
1. Edit `pyproject.toml`
2. Run `./tools/update_lock.sh`
3. Commit both files

### Modifying Coverage Settings
- Bazel flags: Edit `.bazelrc`
- Codecov settings: Edit `codecov.yml`
- CI steps: Edit `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

### Updating Documentation
All documentation is in `docs/COVERAGE_*.md` files. Keep them in sync with any changes to the implementation.

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Coverage data is collected from all tests  
‚úÖ LCOV reports are generated successfully  
‚úÖ Codecov receives and processes reports  
‚úÖ PR comments show coverage diffs  
‚úÖ Local HTML reports can be generated  
‚úÖ Documentation is comprehensive and clear
