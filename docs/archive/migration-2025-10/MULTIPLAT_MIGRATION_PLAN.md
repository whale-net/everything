Yes, you should absolutely undo your binary wrapper change. Using `rules_pycross` is the key to eliminating that complexity entirely. The entire purpose of this setup is to allow you to have a single, clean `py_binary` target that Bazel can correctly build for multiple platforms.

Your `uv` lockfile contains all the necessary information to resolve dependencies for different architectures, and `rules_pycross` knows how to use it.

### How to Build a Multi-Platform Image

The idiomatic way to do this in Bazel is to build a separate image for each architecture and then combine them into a single multi-platform "manifest list" or "image index." This is a special type of image tag that points to the different architecture-specific images. When you `docker pull`, the runtime automatically picks the correct one.

You'll use the **`oci_image_index`** rule from `rules_oci` to accomplish this.

Hereâ€™s the general workflow:

**1. Define a Single `py_binary` and `oci_image`**

Your `BUILD.bazel` file should be simple. You have one binary and one rule to package it into an image.

```bazel
# your_app/BUILD.bazel

py_binary(
    name = "my_app",
    srcs = ["main.py"],
    # ... other settings
)

oci_image(
    name = "image",
    base = "@base_image", # Your base image
    entrypoint = [":my_app"],
)
```

**2. Define Your Target Platforms**

Somewhere in your project (often in the root `BUILD.bazel` file), you need to define the platforms you're targeting.

```bazel
# In your root BUILD.bazel file or a dedicated tools/bazel/platforms/BUILD.bazel

platform(
    name = "linux_amd64",
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//os:linux",
        "@platforms//cpu:x86_64",
    ],
)

platform(
    name = "linux_arm64",
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//os:linux",
        "@platforms//cpu:aarch64",
    ],
)
```

**3. Build Each Architecture-Specific Image**

You run the `bazel build` command twice, telling it to target a different platform each time. Bazel and `rules_pycross` handle the magic of fetching the correct dependencies for each build.

```bash
# Build the amd64 version
bazel build //your_app:image --platforms=//:linux_amd64

# Build the arm64 version
bazel build //your_app:image --platforms=//:linux_arm64
```

**4. Combine Them with `oci_image_index`**

Finally, you add the `oci_image_index` rule to your `BUILD.bazel` file to combine the images you just built.

```bazel
# your_app/BUILD.bazel

load("@rules_oci//oci:defs.bzl", "oci_image_index")

oci_image_index(
    name = "multiarch_image",
    images = {
        "linux/amd64": ":image", # Target your single :image rule
        "linux/arm64": ":image", # Target it again for the other platform
    },
)
```

*Note: The keys (`"linux/amd64"`) in the `images` dictionary must match the platforms your container runtime expects.*

Now, you can build the final multi-arch image index:

```bash
bazel build //your_app:multiarch_image
```

The resulting `multiarch_image` is the single tag you can push to your container registry. This approach is much cleaner, fully declarative, and lets Bazel do the heavy lifting of cross-compilation for you.
