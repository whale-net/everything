# Summary: bazel-diff Evaluation

## Quick Answer

**YES** - `@Tinder/bazel-diff` should replace our custom change detection system.

## Why?

### Current System Problems
- 230 lines of complex Python code
- Known accuracy issues with transitive dependencies  
- Conservative fallbacks that rebuild everything
- Requires manual maintenance of edge cases

### bazel-diff Advantages
- ‚úÖ **More accurate** - Uses Bazel's own hashing system
- ‚úÖ **Battle-tested** - Production-proven by Tinder and others
- ‚úÖ **Simpler** - Reduces our code from ~230 to ~50 lines
- ‚úÖ **Maintained** - Active open-source project
- ‚úÖ **Standard** - De facto Bazel community standard

## Implementation Effort

**5-8 days** total:
1. Add bazel-diff dependency (1-2 days)
2. Integrate with release helper (2-3 days)
3. Update CI workflows (1-2 days)
4. Remove old code (1 day)

## Migration Strategy

Safe, incremental approach:
1. Add bazel-diff alongside current system
2. Run both in parallel to validate
3. Switch to bazel-diff once proven
4. Remove old system

## Key Stats

| Metric | Current | With bazel-diff |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Code complexity | ~230 lines | ~50 lines |
| Known limitations | 4 documented | 0 expected |
| Maintenance burden | High (custom) | Low (external) |
| Accuracy | Conservative | Precise |
| Community support | None | Active |

## Recommendation

**Proceed with migration** using the incremental approach detailed in the implementation guide.

## Next Steps
