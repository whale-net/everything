# Release Tool Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Cleaned up the release tool (`tools/release_helper/cli.py`) by removing deprecated commands, unused functions, and outdated documentation to reduce confusion for AI agents and developers.

## Removed Commands

### 1. `release` (DEPRECATED)
- **Status**: Removed (was deprecated)
- **Reason**: Single-architecture image building. Replaced by `release-multiarch` which builds proper multi-platform images
- **Migration**: Use `release-multiarch` instead
- **CI/CD Updated**: Changed `ci.yml` to use `release-multiarch`

### 2. `create-combined-github-release` (DEPRECATED)
- **Status**: Removed (was deprecated)
- **Reason**: Generated release notes inline, slower and less flexible
- **Migration**: Use `create-combined-github-release-with-notes` with pre-generated notes
- **CI/CD Impact**: No changes needed, already using the new command

### 3. `publish-helm-repo` (DEPRECATED)
- **Status**: Removed (was deprecated)
- **Reason**: GitHub Actions (deploy-pages) handles Helm repo publishing automatically
- **Migration**: Rely on `release.yml` workflow for Helm chart publishing
- **CI/CD Impact**: No changes needed, already using GitHub Actions workflow

### 4. `validate-version` (UNUSED)
- **Status**: Removed
- **Reason**: Not used in CI/CD or documented in AGENT.md
- **Migration**: Version validation happens internally during release planning

### 5. `helm-chart-info` (UNUSED)
- **Status**: Removed
- **Reason**: Not used in CI/CD or documented in AGENT.md
- **Migration**: Use `list-helm-charts` for chart information

## Removed Documentation Comments

### 1. `list-app-versions` and `increment-version`
- Already removed in a previous cleanup
- Removed lingering comments about their removal

### 2. `resolve-chart-app-versions`
- Already removed in a previous cleanup
- Removed lingering comments (functionality integrated into `build-helm-chart`)

### 3. `generate-helm-index`
- Already removed in a previous cleanup
- Removed lingering comments (CI uses native `helm repo index` command)

## Cleaned Up Imports

Removed unused imports from `cli.py`:
- `tag_and_push_image` (from release module)
- `create_releases_for_apps` (from github_release module)
- `get_helm_chart_metadata` (from helm module)
- `resolve_app_versions_for_chart` (from helm module)
- `publish_helm_repo_to_github_pages` (from helm module)
- `generate_helm_repo_index` (from helm module)
- `merge_helm_repo_index` (from helm module)

## Updated Documentation

### 1. AGENT.md
- Updated `release` references to `release-multiarch`

### 2. .github/copilot-instructions.md
- Updated CI pipeline examples to use `release-multiarch`
- Updated helm chart commands to use `build-helm-chart` with auto-versioning
- Removed references to deprecated `publish-helm-repo` command
- Added note about GitHub Actions handling helm publishing

### 3. .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Updated to use `release-multiarch` instead of `release`

## Current Available Commands (Post-Cleanup)

### App Commands
- `list-apps` / `list` - List all apps with release metadata
- `build` - Build and load container image for a specific platform
- `release-multiarch` - Build and release multi-architecture container images
- `plan` - Plan a release and output CI matrix
- `changes` - Detect changed apps since a commit
- `summary` - Generate release summary for GitHub Actions
- `release-notes` - Generate release notes for a specific app
- `release-notes-all` - Generate release notes for all apps
- `create-github-release` - Create a GitHub release for a specific app
- `create-combined-github-release-with-notes` - Create GitHub releases for multiple apps

### Helm Chart Commands
- `list-helm-charts` - List all helm charts with release metadata
- `build-helm-chart` - Build and package a helm chart with automatic versioning
- `plan-helm-release` - Plan a helm chart release and output CI matrix
- `unpublish-helm-chart` - Remove specific versions from Helm repository index

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Confusion**: AI agents and developers won't encounter deprecated commands
2. **Cleaner Help Output**: `--help` now shows only active, supported commands
3. **Better Documentation**: Removed stale comments and deprecated paths
4. **Smaller Codebase**: Removed ~200 lines of deprecated/unused code
5. **Improved Maintainability**: Fewer code paths to maintain and test

## Testing

- ✅ Release tool builds and runs successfully
- ✅ `--help` shows clean command list
- ✅ CI/CD workflows updated to use current commands
- ✅ Documentation updated to reflect current state

## Recommendations for AI Agents

When working with the release tool:
1. Always use `release-multiarch` for releasing apps (not `release`)
2. Use `build-helm-chart` with `--use-released --bump patch` for helm charts
3. Rely on GitHub Actions workflows for helm publishing (don't use manual commands)
4. Refer to updated documentation in AGENT.md and copilot-instructions.md
