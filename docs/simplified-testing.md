# Simplified Testing Strategy

## Overview

This repository now uses a greatly simplified testing strategy that leverages Bazel's native incremental builds and cached test results instead of custom cache management and smart testing infrastructure.

## Key Changes

### What Was Removed
1. **`tools/incremental_test.bzl`** - 82 lines of complex cache state management
2. **`tools/test_helper.py`** - 200+ lines of custom Python test discovery logic  
3. **Complex cache hit/miss logic** - Environment variable checking and custom cache state tracking

### What We Use Now
1. **Bazel queries** - `bazel query "kind('.*_test', //...)"` for simple target discovery
2. **Native incremental builds** - Bazel automatically handles caching with `--config=ci`
3. **Simplified test suites** - Direct Bazel commands without complex orchestration

## Available Test Suites

### Quick Test Suite
```bash
bazel run //:test_quick
```
- Runs unit tests and build checks
- Leverages Bazel's incremental builds for speed

### Full Test Suite  
```bash
bazel run //:test_all
```
- Comprehensive testing including apps and images
- Uses Bazel's native caching for efficiency

### CI Test Suite
```bash
bazel run //:test_ci
```
- Simplified CI workflow
- Uses Bazel queries for target discovery
- Trusts Bazel's incremental builds

### Integration Tests
```bash  
bazel run //:test_integration
```
- End-to-end functionality testing
- Tests app execution and container images

## Target Discovery

Instead of complex Python scripts, we now use simple Bazel queries:

```bash
# Discover test targets
bazel query "kind('.*_test', //...)"

# Discover binary targets  
bazel query "kind('.*_binary', //...)"

# Discover changed targets (example)
bazel query "//hello_python/..." 
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity** - Removed ~300 lines of complex testing infrastructure
2. **Reliability** - Leverages Bazel's battle-tested incremental builds
3. **Performance** - Bazel's caching is more sophisticated than custom logic
4. **Maintainability** - No custom cache management to debug
5. **Consistency** - Uses standard Bazel patterns throughout

## Migration Guide

If you were using the old approach:

### Before
```bash
# Complex smart discovery
bazel run //tools:test -- smart --patterns='//hello_go/...'

# Custom cache state management  
bazel run //:test_incremental
```

### After
```bash
# Simple Bazel query
bazel query "kind('.*_test', //hello_go/...)"

# Direct test execution with caching
bazel test --config=ci //hello_go/...

# Or use simplified test suite
bazel run //:test_ci
```

## Backward Compatibility

- `test_incremental` is now an alias to `test_ci` for compatibility
- All existing test suite names still work
- CI workflow continues to work with simplified logic

This simplified approach maintains all the benefits of incremental testing while being much easier to understand, maintain, and debug.
