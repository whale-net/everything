# Demo applications namespace
#
# Individual release_app definitions for each demo app are in their respective
# directories (hello_python/BUILD.bazel, hello_go/BUILD.bazel, etc.)
#
# For complex multi-app deployments, use helm_chart_composed from 
# helm_composition_simple.bzl like the manman domain does.
